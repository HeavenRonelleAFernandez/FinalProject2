                <p>Poverty, by definition, is not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter. It is present
                    almost everywhere in the world and it is a world crisis that is hard to combat considering the amount of people walking in this 
                    planet. In the context of the first <b>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b>, this website supports this, giving context and 
                    presenting solutions with respect to this goal.

                        have this problem in parts of their society.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p1">Poverty is present in the Philippines. There are many rural areas in the country and only some provinces or regions 
                        don't have this issue to be worried about.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p1">Poverty can be present in society, depending on the conditions. Places like Davao City have regions that do suffer poverty
                        but for the most part, it doesn't have this problem. This is because Davao is more developed as a place in the country compared to other
                        areas.
