                        According to a study, globally, <b>712 million</b> people lived below the $2.15 per day

                        According to a study, the past thirty years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has 
                        significantly <b>increased</b>.

                    <p>In the past <b>forty years</b>, the proportion of the world across different continents has changed drastically, some keeping their
                        place, and some improving. Asia in the 1980's had a rather bad situation with almost 90% of the population living with 
                        daily incomes of under two dollars, but improved in the next thirty years. Though areas like the Carribean has had the same 
                        conditions ever since.

                According to a recent study, most regions in the Philippines have fortunately recorded significant 
                <b>decrease</b> in poverty incidence in 2023, with <b>11 out of 18</b> regions having so. Though, many regions still remain to live
                in poverty, causing it to remain as a serious problem in the Philippines.

                <p>
                    According to income data, <b>3.0 million households, or 10.9 percent of Filipino families,</b> 
                    were categorized as poor in the preliminary 2023 FIES results. The percentage of households 
                    with earnings below what is required to meet basic necessities for food and non-food items 
                    is referred to as the poverty incidence. Individually, <b>17.54 million Filipinos, or 15.5% of 
                    the population,</b> were living in poverty in 2023.

              <img src="images/overpopulation.jpg" >
              <p>
                An obvious reason is the country's <b>rapid increase in population</b> throughout the years, reaching 106 million this year.
                This of course means more mouths and feed and more resources to use up for the nation to thrive.

              <p>
                Throughout the past 40 years, the Philippines' <b>low to moderate economic development</b> has limited job creation and put many 
                families in low-paying, precarious jobs. It is now more difficult to eradicate poverty and enhance living standards because 
                of the government's reduced investment in infrastructure, healthcare, and education as a result of this slow growth.
